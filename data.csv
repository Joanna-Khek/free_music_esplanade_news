29 Apr 2023, Sat, 10pm",,,"Esplanade Concert Hall (28 Apr), Esplanade Concourse (29 Apr)","Byzantine music in the Greek Orthodox Church is regarded as “the history of prayer through song.” Music occupied a central place in the Byzantine Empire (eastern Rome after the fall of Constantinople), especially in the churches. While not much survives of secular music, sacred liturgical music is exceptionally well-preserved in the form of manuscripts, and through traditions passed down orally, which extend back to the rites in 4th century Constantinople. These traditions continue in the Greek Orthodox churches today.
  Rich in history, Byzantine chants retain their traditional elements but have evolved, as new chants, inspired by the divine, have been written and added to the canon. At this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, theologian, priest, choir director and soloist, and proponent of Byzantine music Nikodimos Kabarnos and his ensemble Isokrates present biblical stories from the Old and New Testaments in the 2000-year-old tradition of Byzantine music.

  About the Greek Orthodox church and Byzantine chants
When the Roman Empire split into the western and eastern halves, the eastern half was the strongest power in Europe until the fall of its capital Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. That eastern half was the Byzantine Empire. As the Christians of Western Europe came to be known as ‘Roman’ Catholic, the Christians in Eastern Europe—from churches that Jesus’ apostles founded in the Balkans and the Middle East during the first century A.D.—came to be known collectively as Eastern ‘Greek’ Orthodox.
  While both the Gregorian (Roman catholic) and Byzantine chant are exclusively vocal (without accompanying instruments), and monophonic (having a single melody line), there are distinct differences between the two. Because of its location, the Byzantine Empire was influenced by Coptic, Armenian, Persian and later on, Islamic cultures. These influences inadvertently found their way into Byzantine art and music, even the music of the church.
  Contents of the chants differ as well: while the text for the Gregorian chant focuses mainly on praise, glorification and petition for mercy, some of the Byzantine chant forms (like the Kontakion, a narrative-sermon that explains the meaning of biblical texts) draw on the imagery and stories of historical narratives. Many of these contain conversations between characters, with a focus on the drama.
  This is a dialogue between Mary (known as Theotokos in Greek) and the Magi, after the birth of Jesus from a 6th century Kontakion, written by St Romanos the Melodist:
  She hears the Magi seeking the new-born Babe.
And at once she cries aloud, “Why did you set out?”
They answer: “Why have you brought forth
A young child such as this?
Who is your father, who is your mother
That you became mother and nurse of a fatherless son?
Seeing his star we know that he is revealed as
A little child, He who from eternity is God.”"

1 May 2023, Mon, 5.45pm",,,"Esplanade Concourse, Esplanade Concert Hall","The lama (title for teacher in Tibetan Buddhism) wields a damaru—an hour-glass drum; with a twist of the wrist, two strung beads hit the sides of each drum head alternatingly, creating an even, plodding rhythm. In his left hand, a brass bell chimes in time, accentuating each beat with a clear ring that penetrates the mind of the listener.
  Developed by the deified female yogi Machig Labdrön in the 11th Century, chöd (means “to cut”) is a Tibetan spiritual practice that aims to sever one’s attachment to the ego. Despite its profound metaphysical intent, the songs used in chöd are some of the most melodious in Tibetan sacred music. In being pleasing to the ears, the music is meant to draw in both living and spiritual beings to attend and benefit from the ritual.
  Encounter the restorative experience of chöd through the tantric songs used in two spiritual practices, the Dorje Tholu puja and Terma Lay Jang. Performed by the monks of Sangngag Choekhor Dargyeling Monastery, which is known for its healing ceremonies, the songs used in these practices are well-loved for the beauty of their melodies and their ritual significance.

Experience the beautiful and delicate vocal ornamentation and texture of a solo monastic in performance of excerpts of the Terma Lay Jang. The Terma Lay Jang is a collection of teachings that includes healing rituals. It is associated with grander occasions, such as Black Dakini Day (a day dedicated to the Black Dakini or Dark Goddess, a wrathful manifestation of the deity of wisdom who represents the transformation of negative emotions into wisdom).
  Chöd: A Tibetan spiritual practice
Through the esoteric rituals, meditation, song and visualisation, practitioners believe that impulse to cling onto the worldly phenomena of samsara (the cycle of death and rebirth) is obliterated. In chöd, gods and demons are not literal beings but the mental emanations—anger, ignorance, desire, and fear—that hinder one’s liberation.
  The lyrics are received through revelation—they are a corpus of hidden teachings and texts that manifest themselves to a lineage of masters called tertöns (treasure revealers), at the right time and place for the revelation to take place.
  I, a fearless Yogin in spiritual practice
know samsara and nirvana as equal
Dance upon ego-clinging gods and demons
Grinding dualistic samsaric thought to dust

– Laughter of the Dakinis, Chöd text
  A chöd ritual can be a daily monastic practice, though more elaborate forms of the ritual can be performed during feast days such as the monthly commemoration of the dakinis—divinity in the female form. Notably, they are sometimes they are performed in cremation grounds, which are ideal locations to summon forth mental states associated with an attachment to the mortal body."

With Arnhem Land’s proximity to water, water is a key element in the clan’s dances and songs, which mark major events such as celebrations or deaths. When these occur, the entire community mourns or celebrates with the family. One such ritual is Ayanjanarri, the Water Ceremony, which carries the sorrow and pain of many generations, and a totem is sung to cleanse the mourning family after a death.
  Listen to the improvisation of Ayanjanarri, the Water Ceremony
  Hidden away for centuries, these sacred dances and songs are now showcased to the world, thanks to songman and dancer Ngulmiya Nundhirribala, a revered leader in his community and keeper of the tradition. Experience these ceremonies at this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, where Nundhirribala, accompanied by piano and string quartet, will perform traditional songs depicting his family’s relationship with the Makassan sailors (from what is now Indonesia) and previously private ceremony songs.
  These songs were recorded for his new album, backed by the 40-piece Budapest Art Orchestra and contemporary classical composers Luke Howard and Anthony Gray. A one-of-a-kind artist, Nundhirribala wrote these songs by improvising over his clan's ceremony songs, such as Ayanjanarri (Water totem) and Gurumburra (Seagull totem), showcasing his incredible ability to improvise and collaborate using his traditional vocal style and language.
  About the Nundhirribala Clan
In the barren land at dusk, accompanied by the sound of lively chanting and clapsticks clapping, the men dance, holding flag posts with numerous triangular red flags and kicking up the sand. They wear red loincloths, their bodies are streaked white with ochre, marking the positions they hold in their tribe, totemic duties and ancestors. As nightfall approaches, the womenfolk dance in a group, their actions telling the stories of their history. The ceremony goes on for days, after which, the body painting is smeared, just as designs on the ground are obliterated by the stamping of feet during the dances. These are the Red Flag dancers of the Nundhirribala Clan.
  Watch the Red Flag Dancers
  The Nundhirribala Clan is one of many Australian indigenous tribes, who inhabit the remote Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. As early as the 1700s, Makassan fishermen sailed from the island of Sulawesi to Arnhem Land to trade, in search of trepang (sea cucumbers) in exchange for coins, clay pipes and alcohol. A record of these friendships turned into a culture and spirituality: the red flags symbolise the sails of the old perahu sailing boats and commonalities in language—jaga (to take care), mabuk (drunk), and Dhumbala/Dumala (sail). This culture is passed down generations through aural and oral tradition."
Music,Pipe Organ Recital – One Hundred Years of French Sacred Music,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/pipe-organ-recital-one-hundred-years-of-french-sacred-music,Maurice Clerc (France),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 3pm",,,Esplanade Concert Hall,"Soaring, majestic, powerful, stirring—these are the words so often used to describe the sound of music played on an organ, an instrument that dates back to the 3rd century BC. It was at first an instrument of royal patronage, disapproved by medieval church leaders for its worldly and “sensually exciting sound”. Nonetheless, it eventually made its way into monasteries and churches. From the 14th to the 17th centuries, the tonal palette of the organ began to expand, and national styles of organ building also began to develop.
  Through the 18th and well into the 19th centuries, organ-building and performance flourished in France, advancing quicker than adjacent countries. Organ-building competitions encouraged builders to push the boundaries in design and sound – the addition of pipes that imitated orchestral instruments like bassoons, oboes, clarinets and flutes; and constructing the organ to produce a seamless swell of sound from soft to loud, which was previously impossible. The instruments of great organ builders like Aristide Cavaillé-Coll filled the knaves of the most famous churches in Paris, including Notre-Dame (whose organ was thankfully spared from the fire in 2019), L'église de la Madeleine and Église Saint-Sulpice.
  Influenced by composers like Liszt and Wagner, organist-composers were drawn to the instrument’s symphonic possibilities, and composer Charles-Marie Widor (1844–1937) had mentioned that “[the] modern organ is essentially symphonic [and] the new instrument needs a new language”. Widor and his successors, such as Louis Vierne (1870–1937) and Maurice Duruflé (1902–1986), thus set about composing “symphonies” for the organ. Dramatic and witty, they made use of the varying colours and timbres that the organ could produce. They brought together the vast and disparate elements of the French pipe organ into an “orchestra”, while staying true to the nobility and spirituality of the instrument.
  At the Esplanade Concert Hall, established French organist Maurice Clerc presents a programme covering the last 100 years of French sacred organ works. These pieces are written by some of the most influential organist-composers of the 19th and 20th centuries, and include improvisations by Widor, Vierne and Duruflé that were written for solo organ. One will experience the range, power and capabilities of the organ as a symphonic instrument through their works, while the masterpieces by Tournemire and Dupré showcase their unique blend of liturgical chants with modernist harmonies and techniques.

Music,Mehfil-e-Qawwali: Songs from a Sufi Shrine,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/mehfil-e-qawwali-songs-from-a-sufi-shrine,The Qutbi Brothers (India),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 8.30pm
1 May 2023, Mon, 8.30pm",,,"Esplanade Concert Hall, Esplanade Outdoor Theatre","Qawwali is a Sufi expression of devotion, known as “path of the heart”. Qawwali’s present form can be traced back to 13th century India, when musician, politician and Sufi poet from the Chisti order in Delhi, Amir Khusru, wrote songs that combined elements from Persian, Turkish and Indian music to create qawwali’s signature, exciting sound. From hallowed shrines to bustling Bollywood, qawwali music and lyrics—it is Sufi poetry that is sung—have permeated the mainstream.
  In this concert, one of India’s most celebrated qawwali singers The Qutbi Brothers presents a rousing performance of this ancient devotional form, in multiple languages including Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi, Farsi and Arabic. With a lineage of over 800 years in the Sufi tradition passed on from the great mystics and saints, the award-winning The Qutbi Brothers are renowned for their distinct singing style and modern qawwalis. They are regular singers at the dargah (mausoleum or Sufi shrine) of Hazrat Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki, a Sufi saint and scholar who is regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Sufism.
  About Sufism and qawwali
Sufism was born in 8th century Persia as a mystical expression of early Islam. Its adherents believed that love was a projection of the essence of God to the universe, and they sought to free the religious experience by focusing on man’s innate potential to experience this divine love personally and intuitively. For this reason, Sufi music and dance do more than express Sufi beliefs. They are themselves ways to experience truth and divine love personally. So instead of being something people perform or watch, Sufi music and dance are communal experiences that the audience participates in as fully as the musicians do.
  One such form of Sufi music is qawwali. Its origins are debatable but over the centuries, it travelled with the migration of Sufi mystics to take root in Pakistan and north India. Qawwali has since thrived and is sung regularly in a religious context at the shrines of Sufi saints.
  A typical qawwali performance is an interactive, fully engaging experience for both audience and musician, and may be described in this way:
  A qawwal, which is an ensemble of qawwali performers—lead singers, chorus singers, drummers, harmonium players—sits on the floor at the Sufi shrine. The qawwali begins with a line of melody, the singing of a poetic couplet. The qawwal assesses the audience for response. Building on the introduction, the qawwal launches into the main body of the qawwali, introducing rhythm at a moderate tempo. Slowly, the rhythm quickens and the vocals, handclapping and instrumentation intensify. The qawwal observes the audience, sensitive to any response. Here and here, they see faces glowing with rapture. A line gets members of the audience on their feet in dance and the qawwal repeats it with new vigour, varying and improvising with virtuosity, until the audience and they themselves are lifted to joyous heights.
  The qawwali repertoire: Sufi poetry
Poems of ancient Sufi mystics still make up the bulk of the qawwali repertoire and are sung in Urdu, Hindi, Farsi and Arabic. Today, they are not only associated with religious occasions, but have become a part of mainstream music. Qawwali is widely recorded, performed and loved as musical entertainment in Pakistani film and in Bollywood soundtracks—its traditional poetic lyrics of devotional, spiritual love re-interpreted as lyrics of secular love, and its mystic imagery used for dramatic effect. Nonetheless, the core of its practice still belongs at the shrines of Sufi saints, as a means to connect to the divine. Its rich store of philosophy, poetry and music continue to touch people who encounter it."

29 Apr 2023, Sat, 8.45pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"Central to Islamic worship and devotion is the memorisation and recitation of the Quran, which is done through melodic reading of the text. More than mere singing, there are codified systems by which pronunciation and rhythmic cadence of every syllable are governed.
  Seven recognised lineages or recitation styles exist—known as qira’at, they were associated with different prominent reciter-scholars of the 2nd and 3rd centuries after the revelation of the Quran. These reciter-scholars came from the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, Damascus in Syria, as well as Kufa and Basra in modern-day Iraq; each of the seven lineages reflects the dialectic differences that existed amongst Arabic speakers of the time.
  In addition to the rules that ensure fidelity of recitation, emotion and beauty are woven into the vocal delivery of the sacred texts, through the usage of different musical modes known as maqam. Maqams are used in all music of the Middle East, and to most foreign ears, gives the music of the region its signature flavours. In Quran recitation however, the approaches of using the maqams are more specific, and they are chosen to create feelings of introspection, humility, steadfastness, or compassion, and selected to match the emotional content of the text.
  In this performance, Ustaz Ahmad Daniyal and Ustazah Aathirah introduce the seven recitation methods and highlight the differences in three qira’at: Riwayat Hafs 'An' Asim, the most commonly used and widespread recitation style often used for teaching the Quran; Warsh 'An Nafi', a style named after Nafi' al-Madani, a prominent scholar of Islam in the 8th century; and Khalaf 'An Hamzah', a recitation style is based on the narration of Hamzah al-Kufi, who was a student of Imam Ali (an important companion of the Prophet). Through this demonstration, the duo will also showcase maqams that beautify the melodies and portray certain emotions.
  Mastery of recitation for transcendence
Religious scholars further formalised rules of recitation called tajwid, which standardised intonation, phonetics and punctuation. This became increasingly important as Islam spread to more non-Arabic speakers—giving them clear guidelines on how to recite the Quranic texts in the way that the Prophet Muhammad was said to have pronounced them.
  Mastery over these sets of rules is expected by at least one member of every Islamic community, although it is a personal obligation of all members to practise it. Beyond rules and obligation, the recitation of the Quran is an art in itself, and in its aesthetics invokes in Muslims a profound sense of spirituality and transcendence."

1 May 2023, Mon, 5pm",,,Esplanade Courtyard,"From weddings to child-naming ceremonies, temple celebrations to music festivals, the loud and mellifluous nadaswaram (double reed wind instrument) paired with the penetrating thavil (barrel-shaped drum) are familiar sounds. Grand and evocative, sometimes boisterous, the music, referred to as mangala isai (auspicious music), is believed to sanctify ceremonies and bring heavenly blessings as it reaches the ears of the deities.
  When it comes to mangala isai, the instruments are inseparable. The coupling of the nadaswaram and thavil is a millennia-old tradition called mangala vaadhyam (auspicious instruments) that originated in Thiruvaiyaru, a town in Tamil Nadu. Some believe mangala isai originated from the Sama Veda, the third of four holy Vedic scriptures filled with melodic chants and hymns; others believe it has been around much longer.
  This performance gives you insight into the world of Carnatic compositions, through the melodious pairing of the auspicious instruments nadaswaram and thavil, in a performance of mangala isai, heard at almost all Hindu weddings and in temples of the South Indian tradition.
  Vidvans, devout musicians and singers
Mangala vaadhyam is associated with religious consciousness: the awareness of the divine and of others in the divine. There is a whole series of compositions that corresponds to specific temple rituals, performed at the start to set the mood.
  At South Indian temples, musicians get up as early as four in the morning to perform a wake-up call to the gods, and by bedtime, a lullaby. In between, they also provide accompaniment to each of the daily rituals, which range from announcing the arrival of the village deity, to replacing the idols with fresh garlands. Above all, they are required to know all the corresponding compositions, as well as purify themselves before, during and after playing.
Such is the discipline of these consummate musicians—called vidvans—who undergo many years of rigorous training at gurukul (schools) where they live and study under their gurus. Many of them belong to the Isai Vellelar community and are also known to be expert singers."

1 May 2023, Mon, 5.30pm",,,Esplanade Outdoor Theatre,"With roots in slave history and oppression, Santería is a syncretic religion of the African Diaspora in Cuba. Based on the beliefs and traditions of the Yorubas, one of the first West African ethnic groups to be introduced to Christianity on a large scale, Santería is a fusion of the worship of semi-divine spirits or deities called orishas, with elements of Spanish Catholicism.
  With a myriad of melodic gestures, rhythms, dance movements and praise songs to invoke the orisha or deity in this performance, the Yemaya Folklore Group explores the musical rituals of Santería, in which musicians were responsible for bridging the gap between heaven and earth.
  Clandestine practices of Santería
Santería (the Spanish word for “the worship of saints”) in its earliest days was once an exclusive slave practice that was shrouded in secrecy. It was an attempt at preserving their original religious practices, which were forbidden under yoke of subjugation. The devotees of the orishas had to disguise the worship of Yoruba deities, pairing the attributes of each orisha with analogous saints in Catholicism. This is how images of Catholic saints came to be displayed on the altars of Santería devotees.
  According to the faith, everyone is appointed his or her own orisha, that acted as a spirit guide which they could commune with through ceremonies known as the toques de santo. Music, chanting and dancing became central to worship, with percussion playing an especially vital role. Consecrated batá drums play interlocking rhythms, with each type of rhythm invoking different deities. Worshippers sing call-and-response songs in archaic Yoruba, led by the lead singer known as an apón, in an attempt to reach out to the spiritual world via spirit possession. The entire ceremony often lasts between four to six hours; and while may appear otherworldly, its function addresses the very real uncertainties and hopes of the community.
  From secret to secular
Today, Santería is gaining ground as an accepted and popular religious practice in Cuba and other parts of the world due to the mass migration of Afro-Cubans to the USA during the 19th century.
  Many well-known Latin musicians are Santería followers. Carlos Santana, for example, incorporated orisha-themes and rhythms into his songs, including Hannibal, which includes a Yoruba chant to the deity Shango. Another popular singer is Adalberto Alvarez, whose song Y Que Tú Quieres Que Te Den opens with an a capella rendition of a Santería prayer and makes references to orishas."

They wear red loincloths, their bodies are streaked white with ochre, marking the positions they hold in their tribe, totemic duties and ancestors. As nightfall approaches, the womenfolk dance in a group, their actions telling the stories of their history. The ceremony goes on for days, after which, the body painting is smeared, just as designs on the ground are obliterated by the stamping of feet during the dances. These are the Red Flag dancers of the Nundhirribala Clan.
  Watch a video of the Red Flag Dancers
  At A Tapestry of Sacred Music, songman and dancer Ngulmiya Nundhirribala, a revered leader in his community and keeper of the tradition, accompanied by his son Nayurryurr on didgeridoo, perform Dhumbala (Red Flag) songs among other traditional songs that are derived from hundreds of years of cultural exchange with Makassan sailors from East Indonesia. They also present their family’s totems and songs about the first contact with the outside world.
  The songs are sung in Wubuy, a severely endangered Australian aboriginal language, mixed with words that have merged from old Indonesian and Southeast Asian languages over centuries of trade and cultural exchange.
  About the Nundhirribala Clan
Hailing from the remote Arnhem Land, Northern Territory in Australia, the Nundhirribala Clan is one of many Australian indigenous tribes, who make up the original inhabitants of the land hundreds of years before colonisation in the 19th century.
  As early as the 1700s, Makassan fishermen sailed from the island of Sulawesi to Arnhem Land to trade, in search of trepang (sea cucumbers) in exchange for coins, clay pipes and alcohol. A record of these friendships turned into a culture and spirituality: red flags symbolise the sails of the old perahu sailing boats and they share commonalities in language—jaga (to take care), mabuk (drunk), and dhumbala/dumala (sail). This culture is passed down generations through aural and oral tradition.
  With Arnhem Land’s proximity to water, water is a key element in the clan’s dances and songs, which mark major events such as celebrations or deaths. When these occur, the entire community mourns or celebrates with the family. One such ritual is Ayanjanarri, the Water Ceremony, which carries the sorrow and pain of many generations, and a totem is sung to cleanse the mourning family after a death.

30 Apr 2023, Sun, 8.15pm",,,Esplanade Outdoor Theatre,"Not much is known about the origin of qasidah, but it is believed to be one of the oldest, most formal and esteemed forms of poetry in the Islamic world. With roots in pre-Islamic tribal and court poetry, qasidah, derived from the verb qasada, means “to intend” or “aim at”. A poem can run up to more than 100 verses, and is arranged to a single rhythm metre and rhyme scheme. From Arabia, it spread through religion, trade and conquests to Persia, North and East Africa, Central and Southeast Asia.
  Historically, qasidah was written to be delivered in song. The oldest examples contemplate the poets’ circumstances, praises their tribe or patron, and carries a moral message. Over the centuries, qasidah evolved to express social ideals, political commentary and sometimes satire. Poems of religious praise also took prominence, with the most well-known of them being Qasidah Al-Burdah (Qasidah of the Mantle), written in the 11th century by Egyptian poet Imam Al-Busri.
  In this performance at A Tapestry of Sacred Music, the Singapore Haqqani Ensemble presents Amdah Nabawiyah (a term for Islamic music about the life of Prophet Muhammad), through qasidah as well as nasheed, another common style of Islamic vocal music usually performed without instruments. In contemplation of the poetry as it is sung, devotees seek blessings from Allah, as they express their love for him.
  The story of Imam Al-Busri
The story goes that Imam Al-Busri was stricken by semi-paralysis after a stroke. In his despair, he composed the Qasidah Al-Burdah in honour of the Prophet Muhammad. While reciting the poem in sincerity and concentration, sleep came over him during which he dreamt of the Prophet, who covered the poet with his mantle. Imam Al-Busri woke up from the dream, completely cured of his affliction. Ever since, the poem has been venerated by many Sunni Muslims, recited as well as used to decorate the walls of public buildings and mosques. Some believe that reciting the poem confers blessings in life, removing them of difficulties, cures against illnesses and successes in different endeavours.
  From Arabia to Southeast Asia
In 1200CE, Islam and qasidah poetry spread across Southeast Asia with the immigration of Arab traders. The poems were sung in Arabic, with more popular ones, such as the Qasidah Al-Burdah, translated into the Malay language as early as before the 1600s. The text was sung in commemoration of Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, in rites of passage as well as weekly religious congregations. Shorter songs with verses taken from the original long-form qasidahs were also popularised in performance. The sung poetry is usually accompanied with frame drums such as the Malay rebana (equivalent of the Arabic daff), and the pear-shape lute, gambus."

29 Apr 2023, Sat, 6.45pm",,,Esplanade Outdoor Theatre,"“Korean dance is more than entertainment. It is an expression of a metaphysical philosophy. Koreans have traditionally believed that the human body is a universe unto itself and that man’s ideal existence lies in harmony with heaven and earth.” - Yi Bo-hyung
  Many of the festivals, cultural rituals, types of music and dances of Korea hark back to its agrarian past where farming was a common way of life, and the rhythm and joy of music and dance eased the hardship and monotony of planting, plowing, harvesting and husking. Rather than suppressing their feelings of sadness or struggle, Koreans overcame them through music, dance and prayer.
  Loosely translated as “to play four things”, the folk art form samulnori involves the playing of four percussive instruments: jing (large gong), k’kwaenggwari (small brass gong), jang-gu (hour-glass drum) and buk (barrel drum). The four together represent cosmic harmony: a belief represented in a Korean folktale in which a king, his two daughters and two sons save their kingdom from the ash monster by obtaining treasures from the four guardians of east, west, north and south. These four treasures are the percussive instruments that produce harmony when played together.
  Today samulnori is not practised as a way of life in modern Korea, but performed as a staged art, appearing on occasions such as festivals, parades and cultural concerts.
  Performing at this year’s A Tapestry of Sacred Music are advocates and practitioners of this folk art form, Variety E-SEO. The quartet presents a representative piece of samulnori, Binari, which was sung for happiness, health and wealth by troupes who travelled around villages. This performance is a prayer for global peace as well as the health and longevity of all festival attendees. The group will also perform Pangut, which demonstrates harmony and precision of its performers. See a variety of formations and brilliant movements, produced by the spinning the sangmo (a hat with feathers or paper streamers). The performance culminates in solo acts that showcase each performer’s skills.
  How samulnori came to be
Meant to motivate, farmers’ music (known as nongak or p’ungmul nori), usually performed by farmers’ bands, was typically rhythmic, vigorous and exuberant. It was also a form of folk ritual and entertainment. At that time, another kind of grassroots musical entertainment came in the form of the dramatic musical performances of wandering entertainers called sadang. Sadang (males were called “nam-sadang” and females “yo-sadang”) typically travelled to rural villages where they performed puppet plays, masked dramas, acrobatic stunts and shamanistic rituals. Their music and dances were absorbed into nongak over time and the recent result is what is now known as samulnori, a modernised fusion of nongak and sadang.
  The music of samulnori
The jing is a large gong that provides the basic beats and was, in ancient times, used to sound warnings to villagers or rally them together. The k’kwaenggwari is a small brass gong which leads all rhythm and tempo changes, while the jang-gu is a shoulder-held, double-sided hourglass-shaped drum which plays the most complex rhythm patterns. Rounding up the four, the buk is a barrel drum which plays the bass rhythms. Each instrument represents a natural element (lightning, wind, rain and clouds respectively); two of the instruments are metal or “yang” (symbolising masculinity and brightness) in nature, two are leather or “yin” (symbolising femininity and darkness)."
Music,"Sri Rejeki: Poetry of Sustenance, Provision and Sacred Blessings",https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/sri-rejeki-poetry-of-sustenance-provision-and-sacred-blessings,Singa Nglaras (Singapore),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 8pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"Sri Rejeki is a selection of classical Central Javanese music played in the style of gamelan gadhon, featuring the softer instruments of the ensemble with an emphasis on the singing of poetry. Repertoires like the Sri Rejeki are part of a larger body of Javanese ritual and cultural practices that embody the linkages between people and the natural and spirit worlds, and such compositions are significant to Indonesia’s cultural heritage.
  Rejeki can be translated as sustenance, provision, or blessings. In this piece, the gerongan (male choir) imitates the croaking of frogs during periods of rain. For millennia in Southeast Asia, frogs have been associated with water, which is the source of life and fertility, and understood to bring rain; images of frogs are also found on bronze-age ritual musical instruments. Sri has multiple meanings, but it is also the name of the goddess of rice and fertility, Dewi Sri.
  This performance by Singa Nglaras Gamelan Ensemble features the musical compositions that accompany the sacred bedhaya dances of the royal courts, containing powerful mystical knowledge, and characterised by the singing of texts in a slow, archaic style. Before the main piece, the performance begins with Wilujeng (Wellbeing), a tradition that bestows blessings at the beginning of a special occasion.
  Sacredness of the gamelan
An ensemble of predominantly percussive instruments (gongs, metallophones, xylophones, drums, etc.), the Javanese gamelan is often played for pleasure and entertainment. However, it has always retained a sacred aura.
  Metallurgy has had a long history in Southeast Asia and the transformation of metal ores by fire has been associated with alchemy and religion. It is no surprise then that the forging of bronze or brass instruments for the gamelan requires special rituals. On these instruments, there is often decoration that features auspicious symbols of life force and fertility. Furthermore, all gamelan instruments are treated with respect—some bear respectful personal names, some are given offerings.
  Gamelan instruments and music are pusaka (heirlooms), so treating these instruments (and its music) with deference is akin to respecting the ancestors from whom they were inherited. The aura of sacredness surrounding gamelan music is also derivative of its associations with the auspicious occasions on which it is played, such as wayang kulit (shadow puppetry), sacred dances, ceremonies in the royal palaces, or village cleansing."
Music,Sampradaya Namasankeerthanam: Invocation of the Name,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/sampradaya-namasankeerthanam-invocation-of-the-name,Sri Rajaraman Iyer and Party (Singapore),"30 Apr 2023, Sun, 6.45pm & 9.15pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"The act of singing the name of God, or namasankeerthanam, is a lively form of musical worship that took root in the south of India about two hundred years ago. The tradition is related to kirtanam (the Sanskrit verb of kirtan), an earlier practice from the north that glorifies and describes the attributes of Hindu deities through chant and song.
  In namasankeerthanam, a spirited congregation gathers, seated on the floor, led by a singer who calls out the name of their deity in short, melodic phrases. The devotees sing the name back at him, clapping their hands to the beat of the mridangam (double-headed drum) and kartal (brass hand-cymbals) in a call-and-response manner. The consciousness of the worshippers melds together through the repetition of the name of their beloved divinities.
  This communal exercise is typically practised on special occasions in the Hindu lunar calendar or on days that bear significance for their religious leader or guru. Namasankeerthanam is also sung in processions where worshippers travel on foot proclaiming sacred names, or by lone ascetics who sing as they seek alms for sustenance.
  Neither the melodies nor lyrics—repeating the name of the deity—are complex, as namasankeerthanam is meant for all devotees to participate in, regardless of their musical abilities. The belief is that in the current era of Kaliyuga, an age of vice and spiritual decline, the sincere recitation of the name of God is a way of expressing devotion and seeking salvation. The practice of namasankeerthanam thus allows worldly miseries and worries to fade away.
  While the songs encourage lay participation, worship leaders are often formally trained in classical Carnatic vocals, and in recent times the practice has taken on more performative presentations. From simple tents and function halls of temples, namasankeerthanam has now been brought onto larger auditoriums that accommodate thousands of devotees. Sometimes a percussion solo, which showcases the virtuosity of the mridangam or tabla player—a feature of Carnatic concerts—are incorporated as well. However, the core of practice is still a devotional one, and regardless of presentation format, aims to bring worshippers closer together to the divine.
  At this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, prominent torchbearers of this form of worship, Sri Rajaraman Iyer and Party, will perform two sets of namasankeerthanam. The first features the songs related to various Hindu gods, while the second set focuses on devotional songs for Vishnu, one of the principal deities of Hinduism."
Music,Life and Death: Hainanese Taoist Rituals,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2023/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/life-and-death-hainanese-taoist-rituals,Ling Bao Huang Tan (Singapore),"1 May 2023, Mon, 4pm & 5pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"As early as 1821, Hainanese traders came to Singapore to trade goods such as wax, tiles, umbrellas, paper, and Chinese medicinal herbs. They came to Singapore in four various peaks, two of which were during the Opium Wars between (1839-58), and in the 1920-30s, unlike the other Chinese dialect groups (Cantonese, Hokkien and Teochew) who arrived earlier.
  Being a minority, they often sought each other out, through Hainanese temples and kinship clan associations where they could meet and mingle with fellow countrymen. While the newer immigrants were helped by clan associations in their search for work and lodgings, they would also approach the Hainanese temples to give thanks to the gods of the sea, who granted them a safe journey to Singapore.
  The Hainanese were mostly Taoists, and their ritual music and rites are similar to those of the Cantonese Taoists due to the geographical proximity to the south of China, except that the chants are in the Hainanese language.
  Today, there are a handful of Hainan Taoist priests in Singapore serving the Hainanese community who still hold on to their beliefs, and their roles are mainly ceremonial: the consecration of statues or altars, consecration/blessing of new houses, wishes for auspiciousness, funerary services, and ceremonies for the recently departed.
  These ceremonies often involve music, which draws on influences from the melodies in Hainanese opera and folk music. The suona is the main melody instrument in the ensemble, and is accompanied by the dizi and various percussion instruments such as the luo (small gong), ba (hand cymbals) and muyu (woodblock). Commonly seen at ceremonies is an altar of deities (the “Three Pure Ones”). These are the highest gods in the Taoist pantheon and regarded as manifestation of the Tao.
  Ling Bao Huang Tan presents two programmes of ceremonial ritual music for this edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music. The first, performed during temple celebrations, is a Taoist blessing ritual where the sacred names of deities are invoked, and they descend from the heavenly realms to give blessings to the devotees.
  In the second programme, the priest summons the souls of the departed, and prays for their delivery from suffering before invoking the deities of the netherworld to bring them back to the altar where they can seek repentance and forgiveness from the divine."

1 May 2023, Mon, 7.45pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"The Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, occupies a special place in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions of Christianity. In these traditions, the saints intercede for the living faithful on earth, and the greatest of saints is the mother of Christ. Her powers of intercession with her son Jesus were apparently limitless; murderers, thieves, and every variety of miscreant could turn to Mary to be saved from their well-deserved punishment. She was the key to heaven—the kindly Mother who would not fail to smuggle an erring child into Paradise—and her cult is strong.
  Devotion to the figure of Mary as an example for the faithful began early, being attested as early as the 2nd century A.D., and found its peak in the late Middle Ages, when stories of the miracles of the Blessed Virgin abounded and countless churches in France were named Notre-Dame (Our Lady) in her honour.
  Another strong movement around this time was that of the Troubadours. Composers and performers of Mediæval French lyric poetry and song, the Troubadours popularised the notion of ‘courtly love’, where a knight or nobleman dedicates himself to the service of a noble lady who ranked far above him, whose dignity, purity, honour, and kindness was praised extravagantly, and most importantly, unattainable and to be admired from respectful distance.
  In this milieu of Marian devotion and courtly love, appears Gautier de Coincy (1177-1236), a French abbot and troubadour, who compiled Les Miracles de Nostre-Dame (The Miracles of Our Lady) in which he set poems in praise of the Virgin Mary to popular melodies of his day. Courtly love is now transformed for a pious purpose.
  England and France are often thought of as culturally distinct today, but this was not always so. From the Norman Conquest of 1066, the ruling class of England were French or deeply Francophile, and the official language of the English court from 1066 till 1362 was French. From the 1340s to the 19th century, the monarchs of England and Ireland (and, later, of Great Britain) also claimed the throne of France. Even Chaucer’s prioress (a woman who is second in charge of an abbey) in the late 1300s spoke French as a means of social advancement. As such, trends from France were always strong in England, whether in art, literature, music, fashion, or indeed, religion.
  At this year’s edition of A Tapestry of Sacred Music, listen to a selection of Marian devotional and liturgical music taken from Gautier de Coincy’s songs (c. 1230), the Worcester Fragments (late 13th to early 14th century) and the Old Hall Manuscript (late 14th to early 15th century). Accompanying the voices are instruments, commonly seen to be played by the angels that surround the Virgin and Child in Mediæval depictions."

– Guru Granth Shahib
  In Sikh tradition, no ceremony, occasion or event is complete without the singing of kirtan, which is a devotional hymn in praise of God. A recognised form of congregational prayer, it has, according to the scriptures, the ability to cleanse the mind of all impurities physical and sensual; liberate one from the yoke of time and death; cast away disease, sorrow and suffering; and bring peace and bliss.
  Regulars at A Tapestry of Sacred Music, the singers and musicians from the Sikh Music Academy present the musical tradition of kirtan, which is the singing and contemplation of the hymns of the Sikh Gurus.
  Understanding the Sikh religion
In Punjabi, the word “sikh” means “disciple”, and central to the faith is the relationship between the Sikh and his master, who guides him through the teachings and writings of the 10 Gurus. Sikhism is rooted in oneness and love, and encourages a life of servitude and spirituality. It is the belief that in leading a good life, one must work hard and live honestly, treat everyone equally, serve others, be generous to the less fortunate, and keep God close in the heart and mind at all times.
  Hymns of Praise
Music is a central part of worship, with the religion’s 16th century founders being skilled poets, composers and musicians. The foremost of them was Guru Nanak, who wrote his teachings and revelations in poems, which he sang with his companion Bhai Mardana, a bard who played the rabab (a plucked string instrument).
  Over time, Guru Nanak's hymns as well as those of his nine successors were compiled into what became the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikhs. In the book, the hymns of the Gurus are grouped under 31 raags or ragas, modes characterised by a specific series of notes and path melodies. Each raga has a name, an associated time of day or year when it is best performed, and a specific emotion it is meant to induce.
  In the hands of his spiritual successors and devout Sikhs, this musical tradition flourished as a means of spiritual elevation as they created and developed new ragas, styles and musical instruments. Continuing the tradition, the singing and contemplation of these hymns occur day and night at Sikh temples all over the world."

An atmosphere of joy fills the sanctuary: it is the feast of Easter, the highest point of the church calendar. Up in the choir gallery, the choir sings in the ancient plainchant—Alleluia, Alleluia!, words of praise deemed too joyful to be heard during the season of Lent. 
  Lent commemorates the 40 days that Jesus Christ spent fasting in the desert in preparation for his ministry. The Eastern Orthodox Church describes Lent as a period of “bright sadness”, where the church community fasts and contemplates Christ’s death on the cross. Lent ends with Easter Sunday, a joyful celebration of Christ’s triumph over death. Easter vespers (evening prayers) are sung: texts describing the miraculous resurrection of Christ interspersed with Psalms 109–113, each ending with Alleluia.
  These vespers follow the liturgical calendar of the Church, where Gregorian chants of different texts are sung depending on the time of year. The Gregorian chant, a form of plainchant that originated in Rome in the seventh century, marginalised the other indigenous plainchant traditions of the Christian West in the eighth and ninth centuries to become the official music of the Roman Catholic liturgy. Saint Gregory was the patron saint of choirboys and singers, and the name ‘Gregorian Chant’ stemmed from paintings made to honour Gregory. These paintings depicted him with the dove of the Holy Spirit perched on his shoulder, singing God’s authentic form of chant into his ear.  
  Set in the cavernous Concert Hall with the acoustics adjusted to replicate that of a cathedral’s, experience Easter vespers sung by the Schola Cantorum Sancti Gregorii Magni in a novel way: feel free to sit, stand, or wander around silently, and let the music stir the soul."

  I looked over Jordan and what did I see? 
A band of angels comin’ for me 
Comin’ for to carry me home 
- lyrics from Swing Low, Sweet Chariot  
  From its beginnings over 200 years ago, gospel music is deeply rooted in the African American experience – as early negro spirituals in the days of slavery, and as uplifting anthems in the oppression that continued in the struggle for civil rights. Gospel music has always been a source of comfort and a beacon of hope for the community. 
  Spirituals are the early religious folksongs that originated from enslaved Africans, sung in informal prayer gatherings in the 1700s. With their traditional drums taken from them and their traditional faiths replaced by Christianity, these songs were one of few outlets for their soaring emotions, sung raw with dancing and handclaps, sometimes even ecstatic trance.  
  Some songs even carried hidden messages—Swing Low was a reference to how antislavery activists were coming by to the south (swing low) to guide the slaves north to freedom (carry me home) through a secret network of escape routes. 
  After the abolition of slavery, prayer meetings moved into church buildings of the African American community and the music too evolved over time, with access to instruments and layered arrangements. The churches were hothouses of musical talent, where African American musicians developed their skills and encouraged each other in worship. Their music influenced, and was in turn, influenced by the popular music of each era, with celebrated artists like Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and countless others emerging from a gospel music background.
  Beyond that, the church remains a safe and free space for the community to be their authentic selves, as America continues to navigate complicated racial dynamics to this day. Within the houses of worship, music transmits a heritage of African American culture and identity, celebrates, and shares in the collective joys and sorrows of the people."

An honoured and respected role in Islamic communities, a muezzin is a practitioner appointed to recite the Ezan based on his mastery and expression of Quran recitation, as well as religiosity. This session culminates at sunset with the Ezan* (Islamic call to prayer).
  About Quranic recitation  
Central to Islamic worship and devotion is the memorisation and recitation of the Quran, which is done through melodic reading of the text. More than mere singing, there are codified systems by which pronunciation and rhythmic cadence of every syllable are governed. 
  Seven recognised lineages or recitation styles exist—known as qira’at, they were associated with different prominent reciter-scholars of the 2nd and 3rd centuries after the revelation of the Quran. These reciter-scholars came from the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, Damascus in Syria, as well as Kufa and Basra in modern-day Iraq; each of the seven lineages reflects the dialectic differences that existed amongst Arabic speakers of the time. 
  In addition to the rules that ensure fidelity of recitation, emotion and beauty are woven into the vocal delivery of the sacred texts, through the usage of different musical modes known as maqam. Maqams are used in all music of the Middle East, and to most foreign ears, gives the music of the region its signature flavours. In Quran recitation however, the approaches of using the maqams are more specific, and they are chosen to create feelings of introspection, humility, steadfastness, or compassion, and selected to match the emotional content of the text. 
  Mastery of recitation for transcendence 
Religious scholars further formalised rules of recitation called tajwid, which standardised intonation, phonetics and punctuation. This became increasingly important as Islam spread to more non-Arabic speakers—giving them clear guidelines on how to recite the Quranic texts in the way that the Prophet Muhammad was said to have pronounced them. 
  Mastery over these sets of rules is expected by at least one member of every Islamic community, although it is a personal obligation of all members to practise it. Beyond rules and obligation, the recitation of the Quran is an art in itself; and in its aesthetics, invokes in Muslims a profound sense of spirituality and transcendence. 
  *There will be a prayer corner set aside at this venue for Muslim patrons who require a space for personal prayers after the Ezan. "
Music,Throat Singers of Tuva,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2024/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/throat-singers-of-tuva,Huun-Huur-Tu (Tuva),"13 Apr 2024, Sat, 8.45pm
14 Apr 2024, Sun, 9.30pm",,,Esplanade Concert Hall & DBS Foundation Outdoor Theatre at Esplanade,"Take in the sounds of the land, nomadic life and nature with Tuvan ensemble Huun-Huur-Tu, arguably the most well-known throat-singers in the world today.
  Known as khorekteer or khoomei or xöömei, Tuvan throat singing comprises a family of multi-voiced, overtone-rich vocal techniques common to Tibetan, Altaian and Mongolian cultures, but rarely heard in the rest of the world, and certainly fits nowhere in Western music theory.  
  For centuries, the call of the Tuvan throat singer has resounded in the steppes of Tuva. Sometimes it consists of high, fluty whistles like birdsong. Sometimes it is a heavy, croaking chest drone that seems to come from deep within the bowels of the earth. At other times, it trills like a bubbling brook or thrums like galloping horses. 
  A place like no other, Tuva is a sparsely populated region between Siberia and Mongolia that remained a mystery through the Soviet era. It is a land of boundless steppes, fir forests, jagged mountains, glacial lakes and vast meadows, sharp with bitter cold, and alive with the whistle of wind, the rush of waters and the call of birdsong. 
  It is here that Tuvan throat singing is practised by herdsmen, hunters, shamans and everyday people (traditionally men) in the mountains, on the plains, in their yurts – to communicate with the spirits of nature, to establish harmony between man and earth, to tell their stories of wild horses, legendary hunts and nomadic life, to express loss or love, or simply to pass the time. 
  With Russia’s late 20th century capitalism however, more and more Tuvan throat singers have been invited to perform at international music festivals and on world stages. But the thing is, Tuvan throat singing was never really a public art. 
  It is traditionally sung by one person who occasionally may accompany himself on a bowed or plucked string instrument. And it is sung for purposes other than performance and entertainment, such as praise and shamanistic appeals for protection and harmony. 
  Today, while throat singing is still practiced as part of the traditional Tuvan way of life, the younger generation has begun to depart from tradition. Since the 1990s, ensembles have incorporated non-traditional instrumentation and arrangements into the traditional. There have been numerous cross-cultural and cross-genre explorations and collaborations, such as with Western chamber orchestras and jazz, blues and rock artists. Purists have decried this trend, but others feel that this is how Tuvan throat singing lives on and stays relevant. "

  About the organ  
With one of the largest solo repertoire of any musical instrument, the organ has traditionally been used to accompany voices in praise of God, with a body of music inspired by or written for the Christian church. 
  From its earliest form with seven pipes of different sizes played by mouth, its design has evolved through time, influenced, among other factors, by its changing role as a status symbol in the Byzantine court in 757 AD. 
  By the 15th century, pedals, ebony keys and new parts were introduced to the instrument to enable performance of polyphonic choral pieces that were popular at the time. Tones were made possible, bass could be emphasised and keyboards were placed closer together so that one person could play them both. Builders created instruments more suited to church acoustics. Aesthetically, pipe organs grew more elaborate and richly adorned, and by the 20th century, the organ’s full power was evident. 
  With so much of its repertoire composed to induce a meditative state, or to communicate grandeur and power, the sound of a pipe organ is best described as majestic, moving and profound; this is music inspired by, and aspiring to, the heights of religious fervour. In turn, it has long been acknowledged for its ability to deepen worshippers’ sense of connection with God. "
Music,Call to the Divine: Music of Sufi Rites,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2024/a-tapestry-of-sacred-music/events/call-to-the-divine-music-of-sufi-rites,Kudsi Erguner & Muezzins of İstanbul (Türkiye),"14 Apr 2024, Sun, 4.30pm",,,Esplanade Theatre,"Be entranced by the sounds of centuries-old Sufi music in this performance of ceremonial preludes and mystic songs. Ney master Kudsi Erguner and two of the most prominent Turkish Islamic vocalists, Imams Bekir Büyükbaş and Yunus Balcıoğlu present a repertoire of music from whirling dervish rituals (ayin) and various brotherhoods (İlahi), as well as ghazals from Sufi Poets. 
  The significance and symbolism of the whirling dervish
A plaintive song, accompanied by a drum and flute starts up. Wearing a tall hat (sikke) to represent the tombstone of his ego, and dressed in a flowing robe symbolising the ego’s shroud, the Sufi whirling dervish starts to spin around meditatively, his robe fanning out like a flower. As the music progresses, the dervish removes his cloak, symbolising a spiritual rebirth. Crossing his hands over his shoulders, he embodies the picture of unity with God.
  Sufism is an aspect of Islam that emphasises the emotional experience of God’s presence, and its followers believe that these experiences of divine truth and love can be attained through personal encounters with God. The earliest form of Sufism can be traced back to the Umayyad Dynasty in the 7th century. Later on, numerous preachers who built communities had orders (tarikat) named after them, such as the Qadiris from Sheikh Abdülkadir al-Jilânî in the 11th century and the Naqshbandis from Bahâ'uddîn Naqshband in the 14th century.
  Each brotherhood carries a lineage of spiritual poetry, which was combined with music for use in prayer ceremonies. Of which, the most often represented are the Mevlevi whirling dervish ceremonies (sema) which originated from the famous Sufi mystic and poet Jalaluddin Rumi in the 13th century. He would fast, meditate, and dance to reach a state of transcendent enlightenment.
  Integral to the music is the Turkish ney (a vertical or end-blown flute). With its mournful sound, it is said to represent the intense longing of the human soul and body for the love of God. Kudsi Erguner describes it in an interview with J.Y. Atlas.
  “The importance of the ney lies in the fact that it is made from hollow reeds. The metaphor is that those who want to be open to the high inspiration, need to be clean and empty like the insides of the reed flute. You have to become like the ney. You have to let God blow through you.
  As such, if there is no ney, you cannot properly perform the ceremony because when the ney is not played, there is separation; when the ney is played, there is unity. Separation is the life of this world. Since we are here, we are in separation, but we have this innate yearning for unity.”"

  Both Barong and Rangda are imbued with a strong aura of magic: old and authentic masks that bear holy inscriptions are consecrated through a set of rituals, and kept in village temples where they are revered as patron spirits.
  The relationship and mythology of Barong and Rangda are complex: one destroys and the other protects; and neither one triumphs over the other permanently, but out of the chaos, balance and order is restored.
  The Barong  
Weighing up to 40kg, the Barong has bulging eyes, large ears, and a headdress of gilt leather and shining pieces of mirror. Its hairy body is ornamented with long leaves and colourful feathers up to its upright tail, and glimmers when the Barong moves. Two male dancers control the Barong: - the forward dancer supports and moves the head and jaws, while the dancer behind supports and moves in coordination. Their movements have to be completely in sync in order to perform its fast turns and leaps.
  As the protector against evil and host of all good forces, the Barong’s presence has always been seen as auspicious. Come experience the blessing of the Barong at the festival opening of A Tapestry of Sacred Music 2024. "

Experienced monks are expected to recite various chants from memory—some are known to do so with discipline and speed, while others are known for reciting beautifully.
  Part of the chant repertoire includes a set of protective texts called parittas. Written in the ancient language of Pali, parittas are believed to grant listeners protection from harm, be it physical or spiritual, and bestow good fortune."

The songs feature a range of rhythms, from slow and contemplative to catchy and uplifting. 
  Not much is known about the origin of qasidah, but it is believed to be one of the oldest, most formal and esteemed forms of poetry in the Islamic world. With roots in pre-Islamic tribal and court poetry, qasidah, derived from the verb qasada, means “to intend” or “aim at”. A poem can run up to more than 100 verses, and is arranged to a single rhythm metre and rhyme scheme. From Arabia, it spread through religion, trade and conquests to Persia, North and East Africa, Central and Southeast Asia.
  Historically, qasidah was written to be delivered in song. The oldest examples contemplate the poets’ circumstances, praises their tribe or patron, and carries a moral message. Over the centuries, qasidah evolved to express social ideals, political commentary and sometimes satire. Poems of religious praise also took prominence, with the most well-known of them being Qasidah Al-Burdah (Qasidah of the Mantle), written in the 11th century by Egyptian poet Imam Al-Busri.
  The story of Imam Al-Busri
The story goes that Imam Al-Busri was stricken by semi-paralysis after a stroke. In his despair, he composed the Qasidah Al-Burdah in honour of the Prophet Muhammad. While reciting the poem in sincerity and concentration, sleep came over him, during which he dreamt of the Prophet, who covered the poet gently with his mantle. Imam Al-Busri woke up from the dream, completely cured of his affliction. Ever since, the poem has been venerated by many Sunni Muslims, and has been recited as well as used to decorate the walls of public buildings and mosques. Some believe that reciting the poem confers blessings in life—removing difficulties, curing illnesses and aiding success in different endeavours.
  From Arabia to Southeast Asia
In 1200CE, Islam and qasidah poetry spread across Southeast Asia with the immigration of Arab traders. The poems were sung in Arabic, with more popular ones, such as the Qasidah Al-Burdah, translated into the Malay language as early as before the 1600s. Texts were sung in commemoration of Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, in rites of passage as well as weekly religious congregations. Shorter songs with verses taken from the original long-form qasidahs were also popularised in performance. The sung poetry is usually accompanied with frame drums such as the Malay rebana (equivalent of the Arabic daff) and the pear-shape lute, gambus."

  “Whosoever listens to kirtan or sings kirtan of Hari shall be free of all ills.” 
– Guru Granth Shahib 
  In Sikh tradition, no ceremony, occasion or event is complete without the singing of kirtan, which is a devotional hymn in praise of God. A recognised form of congregational prayer, it has, according to the scriptures, the ability to cleanse the mind of all impurities physical and sensual; liberate one from the yoke of time and death; cast away disease, sorrow and suffering; and bring peace and bliss. 
  Understanding the Sikh religion 
In Punjabi, the word “sikh” means “disciple”, and central to the faith is the relationship between the Sikh and his master, who guides him through the teachings and writings of the 10 Gurus. Sikhism is rooted in oneness and love, and encourages a life of servitude and spirituality. It is the belief that to lead a good life, one must work hard and live honestly, treat everyone equally, serve others, be generous to the less fortunate, and keep God close in the heart and mind at all times. 
  Hymns of Praise 
Music is a central part of worship, with the religion’s 16th century founders being skilled poets, composers and musicians. The foremost of them was Guru Nanak, who wrote his teachings and revelations in poems, which he sang with his companion Bhai Mardana, a bard who played the rabab (a plucked string instrument). 
  Over time, Guru Nanak's hymns as well as those of his nine successors were compiled into what became the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikhs. In the book, the hymns of the Gurus are grouped under 31 raags or ragas, modes characterised by a specific series of notes and path melodies. Each raga has a name, an associated time of day or year when it is best performed, and a specific emotion it is meant to induce. 
  In the hands of his spiritual successors and devout Sikhs, this musical tradition flourished as a means of spiritual elevation as they created and developed new ragas, styles and musical instruments. Continuing the tradition, the singing and contemplation of these hymns occur day and night at Sikh temples all over the world. "

  Experience in the flesh, the exuberant and moving gospel music that not only transmits the remarkable heritage of African American culture and identity, but also celebrates centuries of joys and sorrows of its people.
  About gospel music
From its beginnings over 200 years ago, gospel music is deeply rooted in the African American experience – as early negro spirituals in the days of slavery, and as uplifting anthems in the oppression that continued in the struggle for civil rights. Gospel music has always been a source of comfort and a beacon of hope for the community.
  Spirituals are the early religious folksongs that originated from enslaved Africans, sung in informal prayer gatherings in the 1700s. With their traditional drums taken from them and their traditional faiths replaced by Christianity, these songs were one of few outlets for their soaring emotions, sung raw with dancing and handclaps, sometimes even ecstatic trance. 
  Some songs even carried hidden messages—Swing Low was a reference to how antislavery activists were coming by to the south (Swing Low) to guide the slaves north to freedom (Carry Me Home) through a secret network of escape routes.
  I looked over Jordan and what did I see?
A band of angels comin’ for me
Comin’ for to carry me home
- lyrics from Swing Low, Sweet Chariot 
  After the abolition of slavery, prayer meetings moved into church buildings of the African American community and the music too evolved over time, with access to instruments and layered arrangements. The churches were hothouses of musical talent, where African American musicians developed their skills and encouraged each other in worship. Their music influenced, and was in turn, influenced by the popular music of each era, with celebrated artists like Aretha Franklin, Whitney Houston and countless others emerging from a gospel music background.
  Beyond that, the church remains a safe and free space for the community to be their authentic selves, as America continues to navigate complicated racial dynamics to this day. Within the houses of worship, music transmits a heritage of African American culture and identity, celebrates, and shares in the collective joys and sorrows of the people."

  What does a singer do when they like a song a lot, but it's not quite written for a singer? They sing it anyway and add their own lyrics—that's vocalese. What does a composer do when they adore a tune's harmony a lot, but have some of their own ideas too? They keep the chords, write a new melody—that's a contrafact.
  This project, led by pianist Rachma Lim and with collaborative creative direction from Sarah-Kei Lauw and guitarist Ernest Tan, is continuously evolving. Their guiding philosophy is to celebrate the common thread among jazz musicians—a love for new discoveries, for creativity and spontaneity, and for change(s).
  Join their band as they showcase some of their favourite tunes (some of which may not be recognised as contrafacts!) like More and Mo's, Out of Nowhere and Nostalgia. Look forward to vocalese from the original pioneers like Annie Ross and Eddie Jefferson, to today's stars like Veronica Swift and Samara Joy, and featuring some of Sarah-Kei's very own vocalese lyrics.

Inspired by ‘70s Indonesian hard rock, the trio spent a year making music together, realising that the group had the potential to be much more than a jam band.
  Rekti, Tama and Absar then invited vocalist Marshella Safira to complete the band’s sound, resulting in a potent blend of sounds that is heavy, punishing and melodic all at once. Drawing from proto-punk, psychedelia, heavy rock and stoner/doom metal, the quartet has since released two albums, Tabiat (2017) and O.M. (2019).

  Putad’s unwavering bass lines are akin to the rhythms of ocean waves, while Linken’s drumbeats are often surprising and unexpected, topped up with Wushang’s dynamic and highly expressive guitar tones. Together, these harmonious counterpoints bring tacit understanding and narrative to the songs. Starting with catchy melodies, the trio swims atop waves of free improvisation, from intense climaxes to soft ebbs and flows and everything in between. The trio take inspiration from traditional indigenous songs, harvest festival dances, and Amis art and rituals.
  Each with their own style and identity, they unite to form a cohesive whole. In addition to modern instruments, they also use self-made ones, created using natural materials, which cements the band’s connection and dialogue with the earth. They create their own musical forms and structures, making each performance a unique experience through which they express true emotion.

Known for their energetic live shows and an all-star line up recognised in their country’s music industry, the band comprises Diego Mapa (vocals), Jason Caballa (guitars), Raymund Marasigan (bass synth), Mike Dizon (drums) and RA Rivera (sound effects mixer). The band was formed out of each band member’s desire to play danceable, catchy punk rock, inspired by the likes of the Strokes, Gang of Four, Franz Ferdinand, and the Juan de la Cruz Band. The result is what the band calls now as ‘dunk’ (dance + punk). Their use of vintage analog synthesisers instead of the traditional bass guitar, as well as Diego’s quirky vocal style and eclectic mix of English and Tagalog lyrics have given Pedicab a unique sound, reminiscent of ‘80s synthpop, but with a garage rock flavour.
  Their first three major label albums Tugish Takish (2005), Shinji Ilabas Mo Ang Helicopter (2008) and Kaya Mo Mag Sando? (2012) are considered modern classics in the Philippines’ alternative music history. They performed in Hong Kong’s Clockenflap Festival in 2017 and have also graced stages in Singapore, Switzerland, and the U.K. with the help of The Grey Market Records and Soupstar Music, they independently released their Ancient Aliens-inspired album, Remuda Triangle (2017) on vinyl. In 2023, they reissued their smash debut Tugish Takish also on vinyl, which sold out in under a month.
  In 2024, they released their latest single and music video, Balyena which brings their established sound in Remuda Triangle to new heights. They incorporated their love for catchy guitar riffs, funky and dirty synths, signature disco drums with an infectious vocal chorus.

Music,B-Quartet,https://www.esplanade.com/whats-on/festivals-and-series/festivals/2024/baybeats/line-up/b-quartet,(Singapore),"13 Oct 2024, Sun, 10.40pm",,,Powerhouse² (Singtel Waterfront Theatre at Esplanade),"B-Quartet is a post-apocalyptic rock band from Singapore. Formed in late 1999, huddled together in a small bedroom in Block 22 Eunos Crescent of their grandmother’s house, the band comprises Bani Faizal, Bani Haykal, Bani Hidir and Bani Raizan; the second most predictable outcome of bored teenagers (back then la) and the absence of the internet.
  Prior to an indefinite hiatus, the numerically challenged band—having seen the inclusion of other band members Ezal Sani, Luqman Hakim and Siraaj Anwar—released their full-length album, tomorrow is our permanent address in 2008, and conformity has replaced consciousness later in 2010, both of which were engineered and co-produced by Leonard Soosay.
  With every gig they’re in, B-Quartet plays and performs as if they are still in the bedroom of their grandmother’s house; very, very loudly, until someone complains.

6 Apr 2025, Sun, 3.15pm",,,"DBS Foundation Outdoor Theatre at Esplanade, Esplanade Concourse","“Whosoever listens to kirtan or sings kirtan of Hari shall be free of all ills.”
– Guru Granth Shahib
  In Sikh tradition, no ceremony, occasion or event is complete without the singing of kirtan—a devotional hymn in praise of God. A cherished form of congregational prayer, it has, according to scripture, the ability to cleanse the mind of impurities, both physical and sensual; liberate one from the burdens of time and death; dispel disease, sorrow and suffering; and usher in peace and bliss. 
  Understanding the Sikh religion 
In Punjabi, the word “sikh” means “disciple”, and central to the faith is the relationship between the Sikh and his master, who guides him through the teachings and writings of the 10 Gurus. Sikhism is rooted in the principles of oneness and love, encouraging a life of servitude and spirituality. It is believed that to lead a good life, one must work diligently, live honestly, treat everyone equally, serve others, be generous to the less fortunate, and keep God close to the heart and mind at all times. 
  Hymns of Praise 
Music is a central part of worship, with the religion’s 16th century founders being skilled poets, composers and musicians. Foremost among them was Guru Nanak, who expressed his teachings and revelations through poetry, which he sang alongside his companion Bhai Mardana, a bard who played the rabab—a plucked string instrument. 
  Over time, Guru Nanak's hymns, along with those of his nine successors, were compiled into what is now known as the Guru Granth Sahib, the sacred scripture of the Sikhs. Within this revered text, the hymns of the Gurus are organised under 31 raags or ragas—modes characterised by a specific series of notes and path melodies. Each raga has a name, an associated time of day or year when it is best performed, and evokes specific emotions. 
  In the hands of his spiritual successors and devout Sikhs, this musical tradition has flourished as a powerful means of spiritual elevation. New ragas, styles and musical instruments have emerged, perpetuating the legacy of creativity and devotion. Today, the singing and contemplation of these hymns resonate day and night at Sikh temples all over the world. "

6 Apr 2025, Sun, 5pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"The Middle Ages spanned hundreds of years, encompassing multiple languages and geographies. This was not the Dark Ages with strict divisions between the sacred and secular that people today often imagine. To medieval philosophers, poets and musicians, Nature was written—like a book to be read—by the Creator; one could discover the world in a drop of water or the Divine in the eyes of a beloved. The sacred could be seen in the devotion of a sister who tread the earth in bare feet, or in the way the world springs back to life despite harsh winters of time and history. Deep correspondences flourished between divine and human love, prayer and longing, songs of praise and communion with the natural world. What was real was sacred, and what was sacred could be expressed through the human ability to recognise divinity in the world, and to create and sing about these experiences straight from the heart’s mind.
  This programme features selected lyrical gems that express a sacred quality of Man’s profound connection to nature and one another. These songs span five centuries, many languages and cultures, but they are all stories and cries from the heart. When we encounter this music, we can feel we are in the presence of fellow voices from the past."

5 Apr 2025, Sat, 7.45pm",,,"DBS Foundation Outdoor Theatre at Esplanade, Esplanade Concourse","Not much is known about the origins of qasidah, yet it is believed to be one of the oldest and most esteemed forms of poetry in the Islamic world. With roots in pre-Islamic tribal and court poetry, the term qasidah, derived from the verb qasada, means “to intend” or “to aim at”. These poems can extend to over 100 verses, meticulously arranged with a single rhythmic metre and rhyme scheme. Originating in Arabia, qasidah spread through religion, trade and conquests to Persia, North and East Africa, as well as Central and Southeast Asia.
  Historically, qasidah was intended to be delivered in song. The oldest examples were crafted to reflect the poets’ circumstances, praise their tribe or patron, and carry a moral message. Over the centuries, qasidah evolved to express social ideals, political commentary and sometimes satire. Poems of religious praise also gained prominence, with the most renowned being the Qasidah Al-Burdah (Qasidah of the Mantle), written in the 11th century by Egyptian poet Imam Al-Busri.
  The story of Imam Al-Busri
The story goes that Imam Al-Busri was struck by semi-paralysis after a stroke. In his despair, he composed the Qasidah Al-Burdah in honour of the Prophet Muhammad. While reciting the poem in sincerity and concentration, he fell asleep and dreamt of the Prophet, who gently covered him with his mantle. Upon waking, Imam Al-Busri found himself completely cured of his affliction. Since then, the poem has been venerated by many Sunni Muslims, recited in devotion, as well as used to decorate the walls of public buildings and mosques. Some believe that reciting the poem confers blessings in life—removing difficulties, curing ailments, and aiding success in various endeavours.
  From Arabia to Southeast Asia
In 1200CE, Islam and qasidah spread across Southeast Asia with the arrival of Arab traders. The poems were sung in Arabic, with more popular ones, such as the Qasidah Al-Burdah, translated into Malay even before the 1600s. Texts were sung in commemoration of Prophet Muhammad’s birthday, during rites of passage as well as at weekly religious congregations. Shorter renditions, featuring verses taken from the original long-form qasidahs, also became popular. This sung poetry is usually accompanied by frame drums such as the Malay rebana (equivalent of the Arabic daff) and the pear-shape lute, gambus."

6 Apr 2025, Sun, 9pm",,,"Esplanade Concourse, DBS Foundation Outdoor Theatre at Esplanade","The Indian subcontinent is a crossroads of spiritual traditions, suspended between realms of Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism and Sufisim. Within these religions, many sought transcendence and peace from their worldly cirumstances, often through meditation and ascetic practices. For them, this journey led to a direct, personal experience with the divine, inspiring poems, songs, and sacred texts.
  Even though much of Indian society was and remains staunchly patriarchal, revering male mystic poets, there existed many prominent female mystics whose narratives espoused struggles against gender-based oppression, personal liberation and a defiance of societal constraints—making their mysticism a form of empowerment and resistance.
  Female mystics did not always come from the upper castes. The 13th century poet Janabai, for example, was a maidservant in Pandharpur to the household of Damasheti, the father of the renowned Bhakti saint Namdev. In her poems, she identified as “dasi” (which can mean both servant, or philosopher/sage), highlighting her household duties, her ardent devotion to Lord Vitthal (an avatar of Lord Krishna) and her employer Namdev, and finding spiritual liberation through her faith and service. In her poetry, she critiqued the caste system and the societal norms that marginalised communities like hers.
  Another symbol of female empowerment is Akka Mahadevi, a 12th-century poet and mystic who referred to herself as a lover of Shiva. Her vachanas (poetic prose) reflected her quest for inner purity and rejection of worldly attachments—even clothing—because she was clothed in “Mallikarjuna’s light” and hence had no reason to be ashamed, covering herself only with her long hair to prevent attracting male desire.
  By breaking societal barriers, striving for equality and maintaining unwavering devotion to the divine, the works of these female mystics leave a legacy that continues to inspire. Malli-e-Rohi (Jasmine in the Desert) brings together the voices of these mystics from different regions of the Indian subcontinent. From Akka Mahadevi in the south to Janabai in the west, to the Sufis of the Thar to the mystics of Bengal, the performers move across language and form, unveiling surprising connections in the mystic songscapes of the land."

In its earliest Grecian form dating back to 300 BC, it began as a water-powered instrument that channelled air through pipes. Over the centuries, its design evolved in size and complexity, influenced by its status as a musical symbol among the wealthy and powerful Greeks and Romans, among other factors. Notably, the court of Byzantine Emperor Constantine V gifted an organ to France in 757 AD, leading to the instrument’s growth in popularity among churches of Western Europe.
  By the 15th century, innovations such as pedals, ebony keys, and new components were introduced, allowing for the performance of polyphonic choral pieces that were popular at the time. Tones that emulated other orchestral instruments and emphasised bass became possible, while the stacking of multiple keyboards enabled the organist to reach and play them all. Builders created instruments that leveraged on the acoustic properties within grand cathedrals. Aesthetically, pipe organs grew more elaborate and richly adorned, and by the 20th century, the organ’s full power was evident.
  With so much of its repertoire composed to induce a meditative state, or communicate grandeur and power, the sound of a pipe organ is best described as majestic, moving and profound—music that is inspired by and aspires to reach the heights of religious fervour. As such, it has long been acknowledged for its ability to deepen worshippers’ sense of connection with God.
  Immerse yourself in sacred organ works themed around tribute, performed by acclaimed French organist Thomas Ospital. This recital features masterpieces by some of the most influential composers, dating back as early as the 17th century. Experience the grandeur of Singapore’s largest pipe organ—all 4,470 pipes and 61 stops—as its rich harmonics and commanding presence fill the Esplanade Concert Hall.

Though they were conquered by the Assyrian Empire in the 8th century BCE, something unexpected happened: the conquerors adopted Aramaic as their own language. This was no coincidence. Aramaic's simple, phonetic alphabet and its grammatical clarity made it incredibly practical for everyday use, which helped it become the common language of the empire. Even after the Assyrians fell to the Babylonians, Aramaic continued to thrive, serving as a lingua franca in the Babylonian Empire.
  As the Assyrian and Babylonian empires spread across the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah, Aramaic began to replace Hebrew as the language spoken by the Jewish people. By the 6th century BCE, while Hebrew remained important for religious texts, Aramaic became the common tongue. This shift is reflected in the Bible—both the books of Daniel and Ezra were written largely in Aramaic, illustrating the language's prominence at the time. Even as the Greek and Roman empires took over, with Greek and Latin becoming the dominant languages of law and administration, Aramaic endured, especially in rural areas and local communities. It was in this context that Jesus of Nazareth and his Apostles would have spoken Aramaic.
  But how did this ancient language make its way to Georgia, in Eastern Europe, and why are there still speakers of Aramaic in the region today?
  The Assyrians were among the first people to embrace Christianity, and as missionaries traveled eastward, they carried the faith as far as India and China. By the 6th century CE, the Thirteen Assyrian Fathers—monks who were instrumental in spreading Christianity—arrived in Georgia, establishing some of the first monasteries there. However, the journey of the Assyrian people to Georgia wasn't always voluntary. Sadly, many were forced to flee persecution and genocide in the Middle East, particularly during the mass killings carried out by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, as well as in the wars in Iraq and Syria.
  Today, more than 3,000 Assyrians call Georgia home, and with them, the Aramaic language still thrives. Many are part of the Georgian Orthodox Church, where liturgical chants are typically sung in Georgian. However, in 2008, a significant change occurred. The Patriarch of the Georgian Church, Ilia II, appointed an Assyrian-Georgian priest, Archimandrite Seraphim Bit-Kharibi, to minister to the Assyrian community in their native language. This decision sparked the creation of the Monastery of the 13 Holy Assyrian Fathers Choir, and Father Seraphim—himself a talented vocalist—became one of only two priests in the world to celebrate the Divine Liturgy in Aramaic, the very language of Jesus Christ."

6 Apr 2025, Sun, 7pm",,,Esplanade Concourse,"The transmission of Buddhism through the silk road to China began in the first Century CE during the Han Dynasty. Travelling missionaries from India spread the teachings from western parts of the land to Luoyang, where it gained favour among royalty and elites. Although the religion’s popularity fluctuated with subsequent dynastic rulers, it eventually took root to become the oldest foreign religion adopted by the Chinese people, evolving in flavour and practice to become what is known as Han or Chinese Buddhism.
  As with many other branches of Buddhism, ceremonies and rituals are a part of the spiritual practice. Every monk and nun begin the day with a communal pre-dawn ceremony called the zao ke (lit. morning lesson), paying homage to the Buddha and reaffirming their commitment to the religious teachings. Believing in reincarnation and karmic cause and effect, other rituals like the Yogacara Ulka-mukha are associated with breaking from the cycles of suffering for all beings.
  A rich diversity of chanting further blossomed from the classical or zheng ban style, most closely associated with the major temples and orthodox monastics. Regional styles evolved to incorporate different melodic ornamentation, where influences from the spoken inflections of local dialects came into play. Their chanting of sutras sometimes blend colourful folk influences and surprising musical ideas from the secular world. Instrumentation varies with the provenance of each tradition, from the austere beating of the mu yu (wooden prayer block), to grander expressions of ceremony featuring drums, metal chimes and bamboo flutes.
  Regardless of ceremonial variations, Buddhist liturgical music continues to adapt and cater to respective devotee communities, providing comfort, whether through the familiarity of tradition, the messages of compassion, or the fostering of peace with the impermanence of life.
  Join the monastics and lay members of Di Zang Lin temple for a captivating presentation of the Diamond Sutra Liturgy. This ceremony beautifully renders the profound Mahayana Buddhist text known as the Diamond Sutra, which denounces worldly existence through poetic analogies on the Buddhist concept of emptiness. In presenting the verses through music, the ceremony invites listeners to contemplate the emptiness of worldly phenomena."

It explores how these disciplines intertwine, converging into a breathtaking aesthetic synesthesia—mini-sketches that act as preludes to a broader conceptual architecture.
  In 2024, the project drew inspiration from the textures of the Natural History Museum, the rotations of the Concourse, and the visionary curves of the 1958 Philips Pavilion. These were woven together with the unpredictable elegance of Lorenz attractors, the sway of long-tail distributions and optimisation functions, forming an unfolding sonic narrative.
  This year, the exploration deepens, inspired by the vibrant rhythm of the Maasai Adumu dance, the stark beauty of an ink artwork of a Sapporo mountain, and the pulsing physics of a bouncing phenomenon."

Fortunately, he was a student at the Jakarta Institute of Arts where it wasn’t too hard to find like-minded peers. And so, The Adams was formed in 2002, and they soon established themselves in the local independent music scene thanks to their catchy tunes, sweet harmonies, loud guitars and heartfelt lyrics.
  The band gained acclaim and a packed touring schedule with their 2005 debut self-titled album The Adams and its 2006 sequel release, V2.05. The band took a step back thereafter, but came together for the occasional gig, such as opening for Bloc Party in 2013.
  The advent of streaming and social media enabled a new generation to discover The Adams, which revived the band’s momentum, leading to the 2019 release of their third album Agterplaas. The Adams reached new heights, becoming one of Indonesia’s most in-demand indie rock bands. In 2022, they performed alongside one of their major music influences, American rock band Weezer. In 2024, The Adams further expanded their musical horizons through collaborations with hip-hop artist Basboi and EDM producer Dipha Barus.
  That The Adams is still relevant and active after two decades—from its humble campus origins to the international stage, is a testament to the calibre and enduring music of The Adams. Expect more surprises from them in 2025.

  Through Rabindra Sangeet, a body of over 2,500 works shaped by his poetic vision, Tagore forged a profound dialogue with Indian classical traditions, including Saint Tyagaraja’s carnatic legacy. Deeply inspired by Tyagaraja’s devotional intensity, melodic structure and emotive ragas, he reimagined carnatic kritis, honouring their raga frameworks while infusing his own lyrical and philosophical sensibility. Tagore didn’t merely borrow; he reinterpreted them to suit Bengali aesthetics and his “religion of humanity,” preserving Tyagaraja’s spiritual depth while softening rhythmic complexity for broader accessibility.
  This performance is a cross-cultural homage to that genius: a radiant confluence of South Indian classical rigor with North Indian poetic nuance. Hear some of these inspirations come alive on veena and sitar, culminating in an original grand finale: a multi-raga jugalbandhi composed by Dr. Manjula Surendra.

By the late 19th century, it had grown into a popular music form across the Indonesian archipelago, later extending to Malaysia and Singapore as part of the wider spectrum of Malay music.
  Nobat Kota Singa, an active keroncong ensemble in Singapore, presents a showcase featuring keroncong asli and langgam repertoire alongside traditional and contemporary Malay songs. The programme highlights the depth and richness of the genre, celebrating its intricate cak–cuk rhythms, distinctive cello techniques, and the flowing melodic lines of guitar and violin."
